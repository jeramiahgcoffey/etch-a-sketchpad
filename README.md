# etch-a-sketchpad
## Retro Sketch Pad

This project is based on the Etch-a-Sketch toy orginally released in 1960. As you move your mouse around the grid, pixels are filled with a color of your choice.

## Features
Similarly to the original toy, you can not begin drawing wherever you like. The pen is always "down".\
The app allows you to choose a color to draw with.\
Using the grid size selector, you can adjust the rows and columns to values between 16 and 100.\
The clear button mimics the action of shaking an Etch-a-Sketch.

## What I learned
This project taught me a lot about DOM manipulation. Using JavaScript and CSS together, I was able to create a more interactive experience for the user. I learned about CSS variables, and how to update them via JavaScript, and I also solidified my basic knowledge of CSS Grid. Devloping this application has helped me realized my need to focus on further developing my styling techniques, and I plan to update this project as well as this ReadMe as my CSS skills improve.

UPDATE 10/17/2021: I have gained an understanding of media queries, and the importance of a mobile-first approach. Although this project was built with a desktop-first approach, and is not yet responsive to touch input, it was very important to learn at this stage in my personal development.
